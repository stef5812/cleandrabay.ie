        This has to be one of the best Airbnb’s I have ever stayed at! Derek and his partner were absolutely fantastic! The place was easy to find and navigate. The address Derek sent us took us directly to the front door. Once me and my girlfriend arrived we were greeted warmly with open arms. Not only did I have a chance to get to know Derek and his partner, but also had the chance to meet some of there wonderful guests too. One evening me, the hosts, and guests all gathered together near the piano to share song and fellowship. It was an experience that I will cherish for the rest of my life. I highly encourage those who are looking for a place to stay near the west coast of Ireland, to stay with these wonderful people. I definitely will make it a point to visit them again when I return to Ireland.<br>

        Beautiful location, wonderfully quiet and peaceful. Derek was a wonderful host, very friendly and quick to give advice on where to visit etc. Recommended we go to a local trad music festival in Allihies and this was a great suggestion. He cooked us a fry in the morning which set us up well for our day ahead. Thoroughly enjoyed our stay, Derek is a super host in our opinion.

        Easy check with so friendly people! We we‘re a bit unlucky though cause we have chosen this place to drive along Beara coast which was impossible due to a big bicycle event with closed roads. Also the downstairs room is quite noisy because you sleep right at the front door and you can hear the other guests upstairs.

        Derek and his partner are extremely friendly and helpful. They have a map of the area in their kitchen with thumbtacks indicating locations of interest. I was guided for my trip and their recommendations were spot on.

        the stay at Derek's house was perfect. He welcomed us very friendly and we had a very good talk on the evening, we really appreciate that. The room was nice, we got the big en suite room, because we were the only guests that night. The views are spectacular and the surrounding area is awesome. Its remote, so have food with you, you can also use the kitchen as well.
        We can highly recommend a stay with Derek, we'll come back for sure :)

        Very nice stay, friendly and relaxed atmosphere. Dereck and his partner are very friendly and gave us great advice on places to visit. Dereck speaks French. The house, lost in nature, is very nice with a great view.

        Great stay at Derek's: he and Natalia are great people, welcoming and full of kindness, we felt very quickly at home. The room is very nice with a nice view of the sea and the very comfortable bed, we slept like babies. Derek let us use his kitchen, we were able to eat together and have nice discussions during the evening, it was a magical time! We'll be happy to go back next time:)

        Large 4 bedroom house. The view is splendid.
        The host was not present when we arrived but he had provided a key in a secure safe and gave us the instructions so no difficulty. We settled in like at home.
        When he arrived we had a nice chat in a mix of French and English as Derek lived in France for a few years.
        The kitchen was a plus as the house is secluded.

        A very nice quiet and preserved place to recharge your batteries. The room we rented was very large, comfortable with a view of the peninsula; the bathroom too! Access to the kitchen was nice after a day on the bike.
        Derek is absolutely lovely and available. Thank you for your stay.
